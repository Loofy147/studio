## Core Features:

- Driver Listing: Display a list of available drivers based on proximity and availability.
- Real-Time Tracking: Display a map showing the delivery route and real-time location of the driver.
- Order Status: Allow users to view the current status of their delivery (e.g., "Order Placed", "Out for Delivery", "Delivered").
- AI Route Optimization: Use AI to suggest the optimal delivery route, considering traffic and other factors, and estimate arrival times. The AI model uses a 'tool' to incorporate weather data when determining optimal routes.
- Delivery Ratings: Provide a simple feedback mechanism for rating the delivery experience.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Teal (#008080) for a sense of trust and reliability.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) for clean backgrounds.
- Accent: Orange (#FFA500) for calls to action and important notifications.
- Use a clean and modern layout with clear sections for different information categories.
- Use consistent and easily recognizable icons to represent different delivery states and actions.
- Subtle animations to indicate loading states or updates to the delivery status.
